# Take-home assignment

## How to run it

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Assumptions I made

- Breakpoints for moon phase are below the higher value (except for the last one)
- Forecast for five days means this day and four full days forward

## Possible improvements/Thing I would have wanted to do

- Having an icon showing the moon phase (i.e. one for new moon, one for waxing crescent etc.)
- Going through the types more thoroughly (some parts are likely optional)
- Splitting the code into more folders/files (e.g. one for components, several css files and split utils (one for API))
